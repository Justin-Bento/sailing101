# Sailing 101

This was a project I created for a class during my time as a student at Humber College. The project was made six years ago while I was enrolled in the Website Design and Development program. The goal of this assignment was to create a website based on a topic and present it to the class.

It happened six years ago, so my knowledge of the assignment is limited. However, this was long before AI, Copilot, and all the fancy tools we have today.
