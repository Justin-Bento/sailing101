          <h1>Sailing Rules & Regulations</h1>
          <p>Every vessel in coastal and offshore waters is subject to the International Regulations for Preventing
            Collisions at Sea (the COLREGS). On inland waterways and lakes other similar regulations, such as CEVNI in
            Europe, may apply. In some sailing events, such as the Olympic Games, which are held on closed courses where
            no other boating is allowed, specific racing rules such as the Racing Rules of Sailing (RRS) may apply.
            Often,
            in club racing, specific club racing rules, perhaps based on RRS, may be superimposed onto the more general
            regulations such as COLREGS or CEVNI.</p>

      <div class="rulesContinued">

        <div class="rulesContinuedItem">
          <p>The stand-on vessel must hold a steady course and speed but be prepared to take late avoiding action to 
            prevent an actual collision if the other vessel does not do so in time. The give-way vessel must take early, 
            positive and obvious avoiding action, without crossing ahead of the other vessel.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rulesContinuedItem">
          <ol>
            <li>If an approaching vessel remains on a steady bearing, and the range is decreasing, then a collision is likely. This can be checked with a hand-bearing compass.</li>
            <li>The sailing vessel on port tack gives way to the sailing vessel on starboard tack.</li>
            <li>If both sailing vessels are on the same tack, the windward boat gives way to the leeward one.</li>
            <li>If a vessel on port tack is unable to determine the tack of the other boat, she should be prepared to give way.</li>
            <li>An overtaking vessel must keep clear of the vessel being overtaken.</li>
            <li>Sailing vessels must give way to vessels engaged in fishing, those not under command, those restricted in their 
              ability to manoeuvre and should avoid impeding the safe passage of a vessel constrained by her draft.</li>
          </ol>
