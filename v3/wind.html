        <div class=" pointOfSailItem pointOfSailWind">
          <h1>No Sailing Zone</h1>
          <p>The no-sail zone is about 90 degrees wide — about 45 degrees on either side of the wind direction, or from 10:30 to 1:30, if you like the clock. In this zone, a sailboat can’t generate power from its sails and will coast to a stop. The problem is that your sails luff (flap) even when you pull them in all the way.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class=" pointOfSailItem pointOfSailCloseHaul">
          <h1>CloseHaul</h1>
          <p>Here the sailboat is sailing close hauled, or as close to the wind direction it can. Most boats can sail within about 45 to 50 degrees of the wind direction. (No boat can sail directly into the wind.) Close hauled is also called beating.
          Notice that both sails are pulled in tight, and the boom is centered down the centerline of the boat. The curve of the sails is in the shape of an airplane’s wing, generating lift—a force that, in combination with the effect of the keel, results in the boat being pulled forward.
          Note that the boat is also heeling (leaning) to starboard (the right side). Sailing close hauled produces more healing than other points of sail.
          When close hauled, the jib is trimmed in tight for equal airflow on both sides. See how to trim the jib using telltales.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class=" pointOfSailItem pointOfSailCloseReach">
          <h1>CloseReach</h1>
          <p>Includes any angle to the wind between close hauled and a beam reach. Sails are let out more than close hauled and on a sailing dinghy the centreboard should be about ¾ down.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class=" pointOfSailItem pointOfSailBeamReach">
          <h1>BeamReach</h1>
          <p> a beam reach, the boat is sailing at a perpendicular angle to the wind. The wind is coming directly across the beam of the boat. Notice that the sails are let out farther in 
            a beam reach than when close hauled. The flow of the wind over the curve of the sail is, again, like the air around an airplane’s wing, generating lift to move the boat forward. 
            Note too that the boat heels less than when close hauled. All other factors being equal, beam reach is often the fastest point of sail for most sailboats.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class=" pointOfSailItem pointOfSailBroadReach">
          <h1>BroadReach</h1>
          <p>In a broad reach, the boat is sailing far off the wind (but not quite directly downwind). Note that in a broad reach the sails are let much farther out. The boom is far out to the side, and the jib loops forward of the forestay.
          The shape of the sails is still generating some lift, but as the boat heads farther and farther off the wind, it is increasingly being pushed forward by the wind from behind rather than being pulled forward by lift.
          Note also that the mainsail out to the side is almost directly behind the jib, in relation to the wind coming from behind. If this boat were sailing directly downwind, the mainsail would block the wind and keep so much wind from the
          jib that it would not fill. Most sailors, therefore, prefer to sail off the wind on a broad reach rather than directly downwind. A broad reach is faster, and there is less risk of an accidental gybe. A gybe occurs when headed downwind 
          and a wind shift or gust throws the mainsail across to the other side, stressing the rigging and risking the boom striking someone as it crosses the boat.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class=" pointOfSailItem pointOfSailRunning">
          <h1>Running</h1>
          <p>When running, the mainsail of a fore-and-aft rigged vessel may be eased out as far as it will go. Whereupon, the jib will collapse because the mainsail blocks its wind, and must either be lowered and replaced by a spinnaker, or set instead on the windward side of the sailing craft. </p>
